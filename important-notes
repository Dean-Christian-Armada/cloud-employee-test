Important notes:

1.) Kindly run "pip install -r requirements.txt" first
2.) Did not really use a javascript framework because I use those for communication of client side to backend API and for Dom Manipulation.
	- The project requirements and capabilities does not seem to require it as well.
3.) Contacts template is located on the roots template folder
4.) I included the angularjs, jquery and bootstrap javascripts as it is my standardd project template
5.) Did not use Vagrant because I have limited access to the internet and I am more into Docker.
6.) I used selenium for some few testing
7.) I used django-compressor for auto-compressing upon page render
